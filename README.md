# Ride-Sharing Optimization Script

## Overview

This Python script implements a ride-sharing optimization system for a ride-sharing company operating in an urban area. The goal of this script is to efficiently match incoming ride requests with available drivers, calculate optimal routes, and provide a seamless experience for passengers and drivers.

## Problem Description

In urban areas, ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft have become increasingly popular as a means of transportation. 
However, they face a significant challenge in optimizing ride assignments and route planning to ensure efficient use of resources, 
minimize passenger wait times, and reduce travel costs for both riders and drivers.

## Problem Statement

Imagine you are a software engineer working for a ride-sharing company. The company operates in a large city with thousands of 
drivers and passengers using the platform daily. The problem at hand is to optimize the ride assignment and route planning process 
to improve the overall efficiency of the system while providing a seamless experience for passengers and drivers.

## Features

- **Demand and Supply Matching**: Efficiently matches incoming ride requests with available drivers, considering factors like passenger location, driver location, and ride preferences.

- **Route Optimization**: Calculates the most efficient routes for drivers, taking into account real-time traffic conditions.

- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adapts to dynamic changes such as new ride requests, cancellations, traffic congestions, and driver availability in real-time.

- **Fairness and Balance**: Ensures fairness in assigning rides to drivers while optimizing the overall system's efficiency.

- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Minimizes passenger wait times and provides accurate estimated arrival times to enhance the passenger experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- External libraries/modules (specified in the script)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
